**HR Data Analytics Dashboard — Power BI & SQL Server Project**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes HR data spanning 20 years (2000–2020) with over 22,000 records to extract actionable insights on workforce demographics, employee distribution, turnover, and tenure trends.
Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for data cleaning and querying, and Power BI for visualization, the project converts raw HR data into interactive dashboards for informed business decision-making.

 **Project Objectives**

Understand workforce demographics: gender, age, and race/ethnicity breakdown

Analyze employee distribution across departments, job titles, and locations

Measure turnover rates by department and tenure trends

Track employee count changes over time

Create interactive dashboards for management to explore workforce metrics

**Tools & Techniques Used**
**Data Cleaning & Analysis (SSMS)**

Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Standardized date formats for hire and termination dates

Categorized ages into defined groups (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64)

Calculated metrics like tenure, turnover rates, and average employment length

Wrote SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and summarize large datasets

Data Visualization (Power BI)

Interactive dashboards with slicers & filters

KPI tiles for total employees, turnover rate, and average tenure

Charts: bar, pie, and line graphs for distribution and trends

Geo-mapping: employee distribution by state

Trend analysis over time for hiring and terminations

 **Key Business Questions Answered**
